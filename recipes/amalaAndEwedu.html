            Amala and Ewedu, recognized as the most popular dish of Yoruba people of South-western Nigeria comprises an interesting combination of flavour and texture encompassing so much nutrient making it not far off from an overly balanced diet. Amala is a traditional Nigerian dish classified under the staple swallow category, made from yam or cassava flour. Ewedu on the other hand is its usual acquittance prepared with jute leaves imperfectly blended and served with either fish or beef stew or any other alternative.

            <li>Add water to thin it out if it's to thick</li>
            <li>Take the amala of heat and continue stirring till it's very smooth</li>
            <li>You can serve the amala and ewedu side by side with either beef or fish stew or any other meat option. It's done as you wish. Some also prefare to serve with gbegiri - a type of soup made with cooked beans</li>
