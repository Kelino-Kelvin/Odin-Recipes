            Amala and Ewedu, recognized as the most popular dish of Yoruba people of South-western Nigeria comprises an interesting combination of flavour and texture encompassing so much nutrient making it not far off from an overly balanced diet. Amala is a traditional Nigerian dish classified under the staple swallow category, made from yam or cassava flour. Ewedu on the other hand is its usual acquittance prepared with jute leaves imperfectly blended and served with either fish or beef stew or any other alternative.
