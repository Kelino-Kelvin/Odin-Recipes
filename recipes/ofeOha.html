            Ofe Oha is a soup indigenous to the Igbo ethnic group in Nigeria. Itâ€™s a traditional meal made with the African rosewood plant and is usually served with fufu or pounded yam. Although being distinctively Igbo, it unsurprisingly appears in various parts due to its inviting flavor & texture and its dexterity to give so much satisfaction when eaten with the right kind of swallow.
