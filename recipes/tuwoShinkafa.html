            Tuwo Shinkafa is a popular dish in the country particularly common to the northerners. It’s a kind of staple swallow made with rice prepared to perfection and can be served with various kinds of soups and stews. It’s a meal rich in carbohydrates and is often served as breakfast or lunch. It's also very easy to prepare as it comprises only two ingredients. Wonderful right?! So for this preparation, we would simply be needing: 500grams short rice (local rice also applicable) and 1 litre of water (this may vary as both kinds of rice don't behave the same).

        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash your rice thoroughly and place it in a pot</li>
            <li>Add the water set to boil</li>
            <li>Boil until rice is soft and sticky and water is dried up. We normally say the rice is done at this stage. You may add more water if yours is dry but not yet done and cook for a while longer untill it becomes soft.</li>
            <li>Take out the rice into a bowl and mash it to form a soft dough, then knead it into soft balls suitable for light individual packaging</li>
            <li>Enjoy the tuwo shinkafa with any soup of your choice</li>
